# PlayerJerseyNumberTagger
GUI to help you tag jersey numbers of players in sports videos

This module looks for the detecetions.csv file and images created by the JereseyDetection.py module.
It runs through the pictures and asks the user to determine if the object in the picture is a basketball player or not.
If it is a basketball player, the user is asked again whether his jersey number is visible and to enter the number.
